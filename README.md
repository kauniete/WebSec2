# WebSec-login
https://reexam.indraja.dk/
It is a schoool project
We had to create an application with secure login, also secure it once logged in as well as securely deploy. I chose Ubuntu for my VPS, we are talking LAMP stack here and the cloud is owned by Linode.
My user on gitlab is kreve (so all commits made by kreve is also me). There was a mess up with auth of the version control on Visual studio, that's why :)
